## Description

### Table of Contents
Performance-driven entrepreneur with over 6 years of extensive experience in providing financial consulting, accounting, and project management services. My education and work experience have allowed me diverse opportunities to strategically manage all business aspects of accounting systems and financial operations including blockchain projects.

As Senior Staff Accountant with a proven track record in the financial services sector – helping high growth companies increase profitability, efficiency and service delivery, I have found that almost anything is possible by building the right partnerships and leveraging technology to improve financial processes.

Over the years, I have held a wide variety of roles, enabling me to develop a wide skill set that focuses on leadership, communication and strategy. My professional experience includes project management, financial reports, sales tax returns, and implementing efficient accounting processes.

A self-motivated multilingual professional (fluent in English, intermediate in Spanish and Hebrew) who enjoys working in a culturally integrated workplace, I combine strategic planning with financial analysis to coordinate corporate accounting operations and drive business analysis service, product implementation and project execution.

An accomplished business professional with a focus on making an impact in the Blockchain space, I am on LinkedIn to form mutually beneficial business relationships with like-minded individuals. 

Having originally assured my career path would lead me to becoming a CPA, I ventured off this path when I realized the true implications FinTech would have on our economy. I have had the opportunity to work as an Intern at R3- Corda, where I was introduced to Blockchain Enterprise software development. Ever since, I have been non-stop searching for more information and ways to build skills that could help me be a part of the evolution of this technology ultimately, applying those skills to a position. I hope the Columbia Engineering FinTech bootcamp will give me the tools necessary to consult on projects that asses risk and profitability for the company, specifically within Blockchain. I aim to find practical business solutions that will effectively create a more trusted network to transact on global and small markets. 

Furthermore, the technology itself poses inherent risks with mass implementation, that need to be addressed. I aim to take part in addressing those issues as my knowledge base and experience grows. In the meantime, I am most interested in mastering more programming skills related to financial information and social and correlation trends in the current market. To delve deeper into use cases and where the products that the technology has produced can best be utilized.
